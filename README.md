# Regular expressions and Finite state automata

Attempt at proving equivalence of languages, generated by Finite Automata and Regular Expression.
Only proving implication Regexp -> FA (For every Regular Expression, there exist a Finite Automaton, which accepts all the words from a language, generated by this Regular Expression.)
## Content
- The main equality (`regexp-nfa`) is in file `project/Equivalence.agda`
